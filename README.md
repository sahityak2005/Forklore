Forklore is a Recipe Book Database Management System. 
The project encompasses user authentication, profile creation, and the ability to customize food preferences. 
The home page features a diverse collection of recipes, offering engaging on-hover interactions featuring nutritional insights. 
Users can actively engage with recipes by liking them, leaving comments, and even editing or deleting their comments. 
The platform highlights user activity with sections displaying Last Viewed Recipe, Most Liked Recipe, and Top Reviewed recipes.
Upon clicking a specific dish, users access a detailed recipe page, which not only includes the step-by-step preparation instructions but also provides options to order the dish from nearby restaurants. 
The ordering functionality integrates with restaurants that offer the selected recipe using Google Maps API, creating a seamless connection between recipe exploration and real-world dining experiences.

This Project Is Built using HTML, CSS, JS, GSAP, Node.js, and Oracle Database.
